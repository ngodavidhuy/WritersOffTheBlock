There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  'Writer's Block something something something defeated'

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Anyone willing to dabble in creative writing.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The product is a single page application that'll prompt the user about the what and the why of my app and the experience they undergo once they press 'Start'.
  This app will challenge users to write whatever they feel AND/OR challenge users to respond to any following prompt provided (option). The aim is to just get thoughts out immediately without second guessing yourself, write to write, not to be sitting on the writer's block. If users know their text will be deleted after 20 seconds of idle time, they will be incentivized to continue writing until the option to save their work is available after say... 250 to 500 words? (Threshold hasn't been established just yet...). The benefit to all of this is to free yourself from the mindset of being unable to think of something to write, practice makes perfect and this may, in turn, boosts user's creativity.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  My product will conquer writer's block.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  My product will hold users accountable to continue writing or else they risk losing their precious text elegantly...

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Write off the Writer's Block"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  "Press Start and Write!"

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I use writer's block something something defeated to get some ideas out each morning and it feels liberating to discover ideas i've never thought to think of"


## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  "After you've discovered your new flow of ideas with our app, go out and spread them!"
